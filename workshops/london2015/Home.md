# Welcome!

This Wiki gathers *some* of the knowledge shared in our first conference on **Technology for Investigative Journalism Conference**, which was held at City University, London, September 19-20. 

The event brought together journalists who specialize in cross-national collaborations and technologists working on tools to support them.

Everyone doing networked investigative reporting faces similar challenges, including access to data, the usability of analysis tools, and the difficulty of determining who knows what among your collaborators. Solving these problems will require a new generation of software, but we will also need to find different ways of working together, and create models for sustained funding. 

The event ended up with some consensus on goals, organization, and technical approaches.

### Sessions, Workshops & Demo sessions

Demos: [Oligrapher](https://github.com/influencemapping/wiki/wiki/Demo-of-Solutions-for-Entity-Mapping:-Oligrapher), [NodeMapper](https://github.com/influencemapping/wiki/wiki/Demo-of-Solutions-for-Entity-Mapping:-NodeMapper) and [Paul Radu](https://github.com/influencemapping/wiki/wiki/Demo-of-Solutions-for-Entity-Mapping:-Paul-Radu)._

_OpenCorporates has grown to include 90mio companies, some collected via the Turbot crowd-sourcing mechanism. Chris will share some lessons._
* **Session: "Poplus: Lessons learned" (Tony Bowden)**
_The Poplus project has worked for the last two years to establish tool-sharing and data standards in the parliamentary monitoring domain. What can Investigative Journalism learn from this?_
* [**Workshop: Personas / User needs in Investigative Journalism (Miguel Paz)**](https://github.com/influencemapping/wiki/wiki/User-needs-for-investigative-Journalism)
_Let's give names to our use cases, as a way to be able to refer to them more targetedly in future conversations. _

Jun will present iilab's work on an Influence Mapping toolbox / set of best practices for newcomers. The session will collect participants feedback on the proposed resource. 

**Sunday, September 20th**

* **Session: "Where are we in 5 years?" (Smari McCarthy, Friedrich Lindenberg)**
_Big picture, brainstorm: What are the major developments that we need to push for in IJ tech? Where are our current boundaries? What are the needs that require a systematic approach?_
