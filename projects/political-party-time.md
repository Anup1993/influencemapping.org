## Description

_Summary of the project and its approach_

__Party Time documents the political fundraising circuit. From the early morning hours until late at night, there are opportunities for members of Congress, presidential and congressional candidates to meet with supporters behind closed doors, press them for money and party. Breakfasts, luncheons, barbecues, golfing outings, receptions, concerts, basketball, baseball, footballâ€”the social whirl is endless.__


Rationale (Why?)
: 



Approach (How?)
: By gathering public and private events invitations and even crowdsourcing them though a anonymous submission form, Political Party Time tracks the agenda of politicians, from meetings to fundraisers - and the events&#39; hosts.
