<h1>How to analyse your data?</h1>

Manipulating your data is a great way to try to extract their secrets. Sorting by different data objects, looking for patterns, can help you to see what different factors affect a point of interest, or help you to trace connections. 

It can also be very useful to visualise your data during your analysis. This can help you to see patterns in a way that staring at a spreadsheet or sorting columns in a database might miss. 

You can learn more about analysing data using these resources:
 - [This chapter from the Data Journalism Handbook](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/understanding_data_4.html)  gives an example of approaching a dataset with specific queries to generate a story
 - This section on [Telling Stories with Data from Exploring the Invisible Decoding Data Guide](https://exposingtheinvisible.org/guides/decoding-data/#tellingstories) discusses how to search within data to generate stories with integrity
 - This [article by Moushan Zer-Aviv in Exploring the Invisible Decoding Data Guide](https://exposingtheinvisible.org/guides/decoding-data/#networks) is an excellent critical look at using network visualisation to understand what is happening in a dataset
