<span style="font-weight: 400;">On Tuesday, <strong>July 5th</strong> we will Hangout with the team of <a href="http://ojo-publico.com/">Ojo Público</a>, an investigative journalism organization from Peru, who will share with the influence mapping community the process and results of one of the projects that meant a major technological challenge for the organization.</span>

<strong><a href="http://fondosdepapel.ojo-publico.com/">Candidatos y Millones</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> (Candidates and Millions) or <strong>#FondosdePapel</strong>, is a platform that analyzes ten years of private financing of election campaigns in Peru. The investigation is currently a finalist in two categories of the Data Journalism Awards. The development of the app took an analysis of three million records in spreadsheets, which led the team to learn how to use Neo4j.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">During the Science Fair, dedicated to share projects, tools and prototypes about mapping power connections, <strong>Nelly Luna</strong> (Editor in Chief) and <strong>David Hidalgo</strong> will share how the team has faced technological challenges for the development of investigative data journalism projects and the organisation’s goals.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">In addition, they will share with the community the development and impact of their latest project, </span><strong><a href="http://supremafortuna.ojo-publico.com/">Suprema Fortuna</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;">, an in depth investigation on Peruvian judges’ financial assets and political careers.  </span>

This investigation </span><strong><a href="http://ojo-publico.com/134/ojopublico-recibe-premio-periodismo-y-derechos-humanos-2015">awarded the organisation</a></strong><span style="font-weight: 400;"> with the National Prize of Journalism and Human Rights, from the largest civil society organization in Peru.</span>
