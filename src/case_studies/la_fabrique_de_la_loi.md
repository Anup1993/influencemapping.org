La Fabrique de la Loi publishes and tracks the evolution of bills through French Parliament from their inception to the final publication, showing which the related voting history for the different MPs and changes to the texts chronologically. Aside from the web interface, the data is also made accessible through an API. 

The goal of La Fabrique de la Loi is “to easily understand and visualize the French parliamentary process”. The site and API are the product of a three year long research project between two research labs from Sciences Po in Paris: The medialab and the Center for European Studies (CEE) and Regards Citoyens, an NGO urging for transparency in the public sphere. 

The project started in 2011, funded by a grant of €150 000 from The Region Ile de France to sponsor and support innovation and research for citizens. The grant was used to support the team during three years, including funding the salary of two PhDs candidates and the designers who worked on the visualization part of the website, and to support conferences and workshops.

To retrieve the texts and the different MPs votes, the team programmed scrapers to extract data from different websites and reformat it. However, as Benjamin Oogue-Tabanou reported “this process did not succeed in 30% of the cases”. In some other cases, data was missing after scraping the websites of the National Assembly and the Senate. Often members of the team had to manually input information.
 
There has not been an impact assessment regarding the project so far and Oogue-Tabanou even considers it “confidential”. However, according to Oogue-Tabanou, the project has been used by MPs assistants, by activists during the campaign against the surveillance bill in France to track the parliamentary processes. Looking at it with hindsight Oogue-Tabanou even hopes that the project contributed to raise awareness about political open-data in France.
 
The tools used by the project team are all open source, which is a choice and a statement according to Oogue-Tabanou: “transparency has to be applied even to the code”. The scrapers were programmed with Python and D3.js was used to compute the visualisations. Finally, La fabrique de la loi tried to document as much as possible their technological choices on their website. 

Today, La Fabrique de La Loi is no longer regularly updated and the project is, as Oogue-Tabanou qualified it, “sleeping”, but the team voluntarily chose to upload information from to time to time regarding “symbolic and key” texts such as the surveillance bill which was voted by the Parliament in July 2015.
