<p class="claim">How can researchers, journalists and activists map out the influence of personal ties, economic interest and other relationships in politics?</p>

<p>The influence mappers community brings together power cartographers from across the world to</p>

<ul>
  <li>find out what works and what doesn't in data-driven social network analysis projects</li>
  <li>develop a data standard that can be used to share data across systems</li>
  <li>share technologies that help structure, visualize and analyze influence networks.</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also bring together all of our expertise to map out the network of policy-makers involved in international trade negotiations around the regulation of intellectual property. This exploration will also serve as a first customer of the technologies developed in this project.</p>
