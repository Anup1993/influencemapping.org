Collect,Get Started,There's a lot of data out there asking the right questions and knowing when you need to organise your own data collection takes experience.,Collecting Data,Asking the right questions to get the right data,One of the first things to address around data collection is what your question is or what is the story you're trying to tell. This will determine which data you need. Data collection could have an impact beyond the objectives of your story and it's always important to consider the ethical aspect of your data collection before you start (refer to the [Plan > Ethics section](../plan/ethics.html)). ,"### Where does your data come from?

How you collect your data will depend on whether you source primary data: data you will collect yourself, secondary data: which you're collecting from external sources, or both.

One of the key questions when sourcing data externally, is how to [discover the right data](find-data-sources.html) sources and check if they are right for you.

If you're going to collect data yourself, you'll need to think about:
How will you [collect data](collect-data.html)? Through interviews, surveys, using online tools…

Whether you collect your own data or get it from an external source, you'll need to think about:
 - How will you [clean up the data](clean-data.html) into a format that's usable for your purpose?
 - How will you [verify and control the quality of the data](verify-data.html)?"
Collect,Find Data Sources,,Collecting Data,Find good data sources,,"Web search engines are a natural first go to point in order to identify data sets, or leads that will point to data sources that might not be published.

There are specialised data catalogue engines that might list data sources relevant to a particular industry or sector (such as the [Data Catalogs](datacatalogs.org) site) to specific countries or cities (such as the UK or US national open data portals) or sources tailored to specific professionals (Investigative Dashboard for investigative journalists, or Academic Journals for researchers). 

Also some influence mapping projects in this toolbox have data available for export. These might be good sources for your work.

[include projects with export feature]

You can also learn more about finding data for your project in this guides and resources:

Collect,Collect Data,,Collecting Data,Organise the collection of data,,"One-off data collection projects are very different from longer term, ongoing data collection strategies. If your project is a one-off, it might be sufficient to organise a single collection effort, if not, then it's important to consider the frequency of your collection effort, its cost and the practicalities of the collection workflow.

Different methods work best in different contexts and for different questions. In addition, different methods have different costs and maintenance considerations. Pick your collection methods carefully (interviews, surveys, using online tools…) depending on which are most appropriate for your project. 

Sometimes it is best to start collecting data right away, so that you can get an idea of what the real data looks like. This can inform your data collection strategy as you progress with your project. 

Here are some resources that can help you select your collection approach: 
 - [Responsible Data Handbook](https://responsibledata.io/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/responsible-development-data-book.pdf) : Has advice on how to think about and design a responsible data collection process.
 - [Open crowdsourced data](https://opensource.com/business/15/2/open-crowdsourced-data): Provides some interesting reading on crowdsourcing data responsibly"
Collect,Clean Data,,Collecting Data,How to clean up your data?,,"Whether it's from an external source or your own collection effort, raw data is generally messy. There might empty records, duplication, unidentifiable inputs, and other anomalies that make it hard to understand what the data can tell you.

There are a number of tools that can help to give you perspectives on your data set that make it easier to spot problems.

You can also learn more about techniques and tips regarding data cleaning:
- The [Data Journalism Handbook](http://datajournalismhandbook.org/1.0/en/understanding_data_2.html) has a section on cleaning messy data.
- The [Online Journalism Blog](http://onlinejournalismblog.com/tag/cleaning-data/) also has blog posts on various aspects of data cleaning. "
Collect,Verify Data,,Collecting Data,Checking your data quality,,"Verification can happen at various levels and is an iterative process. Authority and reputation of sources can play a part, but it's important to decide whether your data needs corroboration or triangulation (which is where you verify data by comparing three separate sources). 

If your data sources are themselves compiled and processed from different sources, provenance and traceability become an issue. Verification of external sources will make your workflow heavier and increase costs but may be necessary to maintain good data quality.

Here are some resources that can help you:
 - The Investigating with Databases chapter of the [Verification Handbook for Investigative Journalism](http://verificationhandbook.com/book2/chapter5.php) gives advice on verfying data sets before and after analysis.

Organise,Model Data,,Organising Data,How to choose a model to organise your data,,"Data modelling is about the way you structure your database, so that you can sort your data in a way that makes it possible to uncover trends, anomalies and connections. Database structures can vary in complexity, but it’s key to think about how you’ll be using the data to answer your questions when you’re deciding on their structure. 

The properties and values that you have to work with will have already been determined by your [data collection](../practices.html#collect) strategy. Your data model is the frame through which you can ask what relations there are between different aspects of the data. It requires choice over how you categorise the data - into what buckets you decide to put data with certain characteristics, and how you allow those categories to relate to each other. What you can find out about your data set depends on how you group together certain elements of the data, which properties you keep as constant, which as variables. Making the right choice at the beginning will save you a lot of work in the long run.

Organise,Analyse Data,,Organising Data,How to analyse your data?,,"Manipulating your data is a great way to try to extract their secrets. Sorting by different data objects, looking for patterns, can help you to see what different factors affect a point of interest, or help you to trace connections. 

It can also be very useful to visualise your data during your analysis. This can help you to see patterns in a way that staring at a spreadsheet or sorting columns in a database might miss.
